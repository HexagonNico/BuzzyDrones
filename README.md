### Buzzy Drones is a mod that adds bee-like drones to move items around!

Drones can be crafted and placed in the world, they can detect nearby stations and move items between them.
They don't need to be configured in any way, they can figure out what you want them to do by themselves.

Drones are not more efficient than conveyor belts or item pipes, they are just a fun way of doing a simple task like moving items between containers.
